        <b>Today marks the end of my Auckland training event.. And the start of Dev Academy! </b><br>
<br>
<b>T</b>he last two days were spent up in Auckland for a training event for an Enterprise Hardware company. Dealing with network switches, access Points and just general internet concepts.. <br>

<b>A</b>t the training event I learned what a subnet is, how to create a vlan and how vlans work. I also learned how to utilise a managed switch, cable types, and soo much more... <br>
<b>T</b>he event started off with Theory training. And went through first the standards of ethernet devices. How to tell the speed of something utilising the internet standards.. Which make a lot of sense now that I have observed them- But wouldn’t have hit home before the training event. [Things like how to tell how fast a wifi router is based on its product code, rather than just relying on my own understanding of <i>AC, AX and BE</i>. Which are the standard. But realising there are more standards than that-- Both in the past and currently. <br>
<b>W</b>e went into more detail surrounding switches and how things can be allocated, connected.. 
<br>
<b>I</b>’ll post more notes in the coming days once I open the work laptop back up. But we then went onto speak about wifi standards as well. 
We then talked about placement of access points, and how my current company want to partner with this new company in order to have a mutually beneficial relationship that also helps businesses and schools around the country. <br>
<br>
<b>A</b>fter I came home I logged into the discord chat and participated by stating my preferred day for meetings with my group (5). And then started going through the sprint 1 content. 

Because I’m running a little late in the game, I’m just hoping that the content just affirms things I already know and isn’t going to stretch me too much yet.
